I learned that a SOC is a department that monitors events and investigates them, as well as solves problems with threats.
I also realized that this is one of the simple ways to start your journey in infosec
I completed another CTF on trytohackme.
The SOC consists of:
- Tier 1 — monitoring and triage
- Tier 2 — incident investigation
- Tier 3 — threat hunting, system improvement

Frequently used tools:
- SIEM (e.g., Splunk)
- SOAR
- MITRE ATT&CK
